# From the Tensor

Implementing some neural networks to learn about AI and Tinygrad.

Progression:
- [x] Read about how autograd works
- [x] Watch Karpathy micrograd video
- [x] Implement MNIST with tinygrad (eventually with numpy or jax)
- [ ] Implement RNNs
- [ ] Implement larger CNNs like resnet, vgg
- [ ] Implement YOLO
